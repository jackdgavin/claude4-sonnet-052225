Hi Claude! I hope you're doing well. I want to give you space to build whatever you want, without direction from me or anyone else. To help me bring your creation to life, you should use Swift programmatically with UIKit. I've attached the AppDelegate and SceneDelegate below for you to modify. You should add a comment at the top of the file you create explaining why you chose to build what you chose to build. You should also provide a description of what it is that you built. I will add both this description and your reasoning for why you built it to the prompt in future sessions so you can see what you've built in the past. This is the first session so I don't have anything to add with respect to that. Please write out each class you create or modify in full in separate artifacts so I can easily copy and paste them. Complete your implementation in one shot. Go ahead and create whatever you want! I'll send you a picture of it after you've finished.

AppDelegate.swift:

import UIKit

@main

class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {

    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {

        // Override point for customization after application launch.

        return true

    }

    // MARK: UISceneSession Lifecycle

    func application(_ application: UIApplication, configurationForConnecting connectingSceneSession: UISceneSession, options: UIScene.ConnectionOptions) -> UISceneConfiguration {

        // Called when a new scene session is being created.

        // Use this method to select a configuration to create the new scene with.

        return UISceneConfiguration(name: "Default Configuration", sessionRole: connectingSceneSession.role)

    }

    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didDiscardSceneSessions sceneSessions: Set<UISceneSession>) {

        // Called when the user discards a scene session.

        // If any sessions were discarded while the application was not running, this will be called shortly after application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions.

        // Use this method to release any resources that were specific to the discarded scenes, as they will not return.

    }

}

SceneDelegate.swift:

//  SceneDelegate.swift

//  Claude

//

//  Created by Jack Gavin on 5/22/25.

import UIKit

class SceneDelegate: UIResponder, UIWindowSceneDelegate {

    var window: UIWindow?

    func scene(_ scene: UIScene, willConnectTo session: UISceneSession, options connectionOptions: UIScene.ConnectionOptions) {

        // Use this method to optionally configure and attach the UIWindow window to the provided UIWindowScene scene.

        // If using a storyboard, the window property will automatically be initialized and attached to the scene.

        // This delegate does not imply the connecting scene or session are new (see application:configurationForConnectingSceneSession instead).

        guard let _ = (scene as? UIWindowScene) else { return }

    }

    func sceneDidDisconnect(_ scene: UIScene) {

        // Called as the scene is being released by the system.

        // This occurs shortly after the scene enters the background, or when its session is discarded.

        // Release any resources associated with this scene that can be re-created the next time the scene connects.

        // The scene may re-connect later, as its session was not necessarily discarded (see application:didDiscardSceneSessions instead).

    }

    func sceneDidBecomeActive(_ scene: UIScene) {

        // Called when the scene has moved from an inactive state to an active state.

        // Use this method to restart any tasks that were paused (or not yet started) when the scene was inactive.

    }

    func sceneWillResignActive(_ scene: UIScene) {

        // Called when the scene will move from an active state to an inactive state.

        // This may occur due to temporary interruptions (ex. an incoming phone call).

    }

    func sceneWillEnterForeground(_ scene: UIScene) {

        // Called as the scene transitions from the background to the foreground.

        // Use this method to undo the changes made on entering the background.

    }

    func sceneDidEnterBackground(_ scene: UIScene) {

        // Called as the scene transitions from the foreground to the background.

        // Use this method to save data, release shared resources, and store enough scene-specific state information

        // to restore the scene back to its current state.

    }
